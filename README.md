# Employee-Performance-Optimization-Model
Our Client witnessed increased customer escalations due to decreased employee performance. We have undertaken this project to deliver Hindsight, Insight &amp; foresight related to Performance.

Roles & Responsibilities:

I filtered the correct parameters based on comprehensive data from the provided business use case.

Reported Hindsight and Insights to the Stakeholders by using SQL, Power BI & Python.

Developed a Predictive Model to Foresight less performing employees and to handle those employees proactively.

Before implementing the Data-Driven Decision making, we noticed a 30% Increase in Escalations. With the help of Data-Driven Decision making, we saw 16% fewer escalations.
